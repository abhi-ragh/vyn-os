# VynOS

VynOS is a lightweight, Linux-based general-purpose operating system engineered for efficiency and speed. It is designed to bridge the gap between modern performance requirements and legacy systems, offering a streamlined, secure, and responsive computing experience.

## How VynOS Came Into Existence

VynOS was developed as part of our Final Year BTech Computer Science project.  
**Why build an operating system?**  
After years of using Linux, I wanted to experiment and create something unique. VynOS is based on Ubuntu and uses Cinnamon as its Desktop Environment, enhanced by a custom theme named "Vyn OS" built on the Fluent GTK theme. Cinnamon was chosen for its modern interface and its excellent performance on low-end hardware.

## Key Features

- **Custom Theme:**  
  A unique, custom-designed theme enhances the overall user experience and visual appeal.
  
- **Power Management Enhancements:**  
  Integration of TLP and Powertop optimizes power usage and improves battery life, making VynOS ideal for low-end systems.
  
- **Windows Compatibility:**  
  Wine support is built in to seamlessly run Windows applications.

- **Custom Applications:**  
  VynOS comes with a suite of preinstalled custom apps developed as part of our project, including:
  - **RoboDumb** and **TicTacWar:** Engaging games for casual entertainment.
  - **Vyn Player:** A dedicated media player.
  - **Vyn Photos:** A streamlined photo viewer.
  - **Vyn Terminal:** A customized terminal application for enhanced productivity.
